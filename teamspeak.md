# teamspeak

this file assumes you use teamspeak3


## install plugins

to install plugins use the application `package_inst` located in teamspeaks installation directory.
for me on arch linux teamspeak installed to `/opt/teamspeak3/`.

```sh
# usage of `package_inst`
<teamspeak3-install-directory>/package_inst <path-to-plugin>

# example on my system
/opt/teamspeak3/package_inst ~/Downloads/XeonStyle.ts3_style
```
