# markdown

## links

To insert links directly in the text use:
```markdown
[display name](url-or-link-to-markdown-anker)
```
Links can be defined in a separate (not rendered) section as follows:
```markdown
[display name]: url-or-link-to-markdown-anker

Reference the Link in text with [display name].
```
In the last example the Link can be defined after the usage.
